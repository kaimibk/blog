**Description:** Powerful radio jets produced by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect the evolution of galaxies by driving massive gas outflows. Although much work has been done on radio jets, the impact of these jets on the host galaxies still requires more study. I will be analyzing visible light spectra of 3 young radio galaxies using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-N) on Mauna Kea. By analyzing the emission lines of the 3 selected radio galaxies, I will try to determine the following: how the local gas clouds are interacting with the radio jets, the mass outflow rate, and the heavy element abundance in the gas outflow. This project seeks to put constraints on the impacts radio-jet-driven outflows have on their host galaxies.
