**Description:** Binary stars, under certain conditions, can form symbiotic binary star systems—a process by which one star begins to devour its companion. These symbiotic binary stars are progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, and although heavily studied, no pre-Ia supernova has been directly observed. By re-purposing data from the Kepler telescope, 3 potential symbiotic stars have been detected through photometric analyses of their light curves. Currently, follow-up, conformation, analyses are being conducted in H-alpha utilizing the 2.0m Faulkes telescope on Haleakala. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a census of symbiotic systems. Understanding the pre-Ia supernova system may help astronomers better understand dark energy, as well as place constraints on systems that have the potential to harbor intelligent life.
