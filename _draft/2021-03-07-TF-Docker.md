## Coming soon

Tutorial on how to run Tensorflow 2.0 examples in a jupyter notebook server hosted in a docker container environment.

**Note:** None of these tutorials are my own, they are available on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/). The goal of this repository is to replicate these tutorials in a dockerized environment for educational purposes.

Any additions made to the content will be indicated within the corresponding notebooks.
