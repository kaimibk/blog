title:  Smoked Cinnamon Old Fashioned
excerpt: An extra smoky tequila based old fashioned smoked with Kiawe wood
ingredients:
    - ingredient: Bourbon, Cask Strength
      amount: 1.5 oz
      brand: Makers Mark Private Select
    - ingredient: Maple Syrup
      amount: 1 tsp
    - ingredient: Aromatic Bitters
      amount: 3 dashes
      brand: Angostura
    - ingredient: Cinnamon
      amount: One whole stick
notes:
    - Begin by torching the top of a cinnamon stick on fire. When lit, invert a decanter over top to capture the smoke. When the decanter is opaque, quickly seal the top. Put aside for later.
    - Combine remaining ingredients in a mixing glass over ice and stir.
    - Pour drink into the smoke-filled decanter. Swirl for 5-10 seconds. The longer you swirl, the more smokey the cocktail.
    - Transfer drink into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.
