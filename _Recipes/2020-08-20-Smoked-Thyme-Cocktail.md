notes:
    - Begin by lighting the dried thyme leaves on fire. When lit, invert a decanter over top to capture smoke. When the decanter is opaque, quickly seal the top. Put aside for later.
    - Combine remaining ingredients in a mixing glass over ice and stir.
    - Pour drink into the smoke-filled decanter. Swirl for 5-10 seconds. The longer you swirl, the more smokey the cocktail.
    - Transfer drink into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.
