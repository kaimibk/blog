title:  Smoked Oaxacan Old Fashioned
excerpt: An extra smoky tequila based old fashioned smoked with Kiawe wood
ingredients:
    - ingredient: Tequila, Reposado
      amount: 1.5 oz
      brand: Xicaru
    - ingredient: Agave Syrup
      amount: 1 tsp
    - ingredient: Orange Bitters
      amount: 2 dashes
      brand: Angostura
    - ingredient: Kiawe Wood
      amount: Small chips
garnishes:
  - Orange peel
notes:
    - Begin by lighting the Kiawe wood chips on fire. When lit, invert a decanter over top to capture smoke. When the decanter is opaque, quickly seal the top. Put aside for later.
    - Combine remaining ingredients in a mixing glass over ice and stir.
    - Pour drink into the smoke-filled decanter. Swirl for 5-10 seconds. The longer you swirl, the more smokey the cocktail.
    - Transfer drink into a rocks glass over a large ice cube and express an orange peel over the glass.
