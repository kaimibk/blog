## Introduction

This is a simple tutorial on how to run Tensorflow 2.0 example jupyter notebooks in a docker container environment. If you are new to Docker, it is a fantastic tool for developing reproducible applications. This will tutorial will not be an indepth tutorial to Docker, if you are interested in an introduction, see [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). 

One major benefit of Docker is the ability to share and replicate your development environment with collaborators (and to avoid getting stuck in [_dependency hell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell)). Assuming your collaborators have Docker (or Docker-Compose, if required), standing up an identical and isolated development environment only requires running a few commands!

As data scientists, it is common for us to exclusively live in Jupyter notebooks (for better, or for worse) to perform a variety of tasks&mdash;from exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, training, etc. Additionally, we want to ensure our Jupyter environemnt has the proper dependencies to perform our analysis.

**Note:** None of these tutorials are my own, they are all available on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/). The goal of this repository is to replicate these tutorials in a dockerized environment for educational purposes. Any modifications to the content will be indicated accordingly.

## Docker Compose Configuration File

In this tutorial, we are keeping things simple. We will first start by creating a `docker-compose.yml` file. Generally, these files are used to specify the various services you would like for Docker to stand up&mdash;if you are dealing with a multi-container environment. In this example, our `docker-compose.yml` will only contain a single service, however this serves as an example of how to include a simple jupyter server to another docker stack.

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  tf-jupyter:
    image: jupyter/tensorflow-notebook:latest
    environment:
      - JUPYTER_TOKEN=jupyter
    volumes:
      - ./tutorials:/tf/tutorials
    working_dir: /tf/tutorials/
    ports:
      # Jupyter port
      - "8888:8888"
      # Tensorboard port
      - "6006:6006"
```

Let's break things down line-by-line.

First `version: "3.7"` specifies the version of docker-compose to use. At a high level, different versions of docker-compose have different parameters you can specify.

Second, we define the various `services` to stand up, however since we only have a single service, we only see a single entry. If wanted multiple services, your file may look like:

```yaml
version: ...
services:
  service-a:
    ...
  service-b:
    ...
  service-c:
    ...
  ...
```

Next, we define our service Jupyter notebook service. We start by defining the "image" to start from. 

```yaml
image: jupyter/tensorflow-notebook:latest
```
As a reminder, an image contains a frozen copy of a development environment. In this example, we are starting from an environment created by the Jupyter team that comes pre-installed with a lot of useful tools for running Tensorflow code.  What this line is saying is start from the `tensorflow-notebook` image made by `jupyter`, and specifically, grab the `latest` version of this environment&mdash;you can also specify specific versions.

Optionally, we can define environment variables for the container.

```yaml
environment:
  - JUPYTER_TOKEN=jupyter
```

In this example, we defining a single environment variable called `JUPYTER_TOKEN`, which, if you aren't familiar with Jupyter, is essentially a password to access the server. So here, we are setting the password to `jupyter`&mdash;[later in this post](#securing-environment-variables) I will show you a tip for securing your environment variables. Again, this is optional. If you remove this section of the config, Jupyter will start with no password required.

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./tutorials:/tf/tutorials
```
Here we "mount" a `volume`, which essentially means "copy" files from your local machine to a specific directory in the container (whether or not it exists). Above, we mount the entire tutorials folder into a directory called `/tf/tutorials`. Note, this directory does not exist in the container, we are instructing docker-compose to make this directory and copy the contents to it. This way, we can access our notebooks from the container and our changes persist upon spinning down the container.

```yaml
working_dir: /tf/tutorials/
```
This tells docker-compose to `cd` us into the `/tf/tutorials/` directory upon entering it.

```yaml
ports:
  # Jupyter port
  - "8888:8888"
  # Tensorboard port
  - "6006:6006"
```

For this container, we would like to start up two servers, one for Jupyter notebook and another for Tensorboard (if we elect to use it). In order for our local computer to actually access these servers, we must specify the port(s) to expose. Here we tell Jupyter to be accessible on port `8888` by the host (our local computer) and run on port `8888` within the container. What this implies is that we can forward the port to another, if there are port conflicts. Simiarly, for tensorboard, we expose `6006`.

And that's it for the configuration file!

## How to Run Your Container(s)

Now here is the time to show the power of Docker. Assuming you are `cd`'d into the proper directory, if you run from a terminal/command prompt:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Docker will start up a service called `tf-jupyter`. 

```shell
Creating network "tf_tutorials_default" with the default driver
Creating tf_tutorials_tf-jupyter_1 ...
```

If this is your first time running the command, it will take a while to execute as it is downloading all of the required dependencies. Note, the next time you run this command, you will not have to wait as long.

After everything downloads, you should finally see the following in your terminal:

```shell
tf-jupyter_1  | [I 2021-04-09 04:01:24.038 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /opt/conda/share/jupyter/lab
tf-jupyter_1  | [I 04:01:24.043 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /tf/tutorials
tf-jupyter_1  | [I 04:01:24.043 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.2.0 is running at:
tf-jupyter_1  | [I 04:01:24.043 NotebookApp] http://23b09491f9c6:8888/?token=...
tf-jupyter_1  | [I 04:01:24.043 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...
tf-jupyter_1  | [I 04:01:24.043 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

You now have a Jupyter notebook server running! If you visit `localhost:8888` in your browser, you will arrive on this page:

![jupyter notebook password prompt]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2021-03-07-TF_Docker/jupyter-start-sreen.png)

Recall, the password/token for this Jupyter server is `jupyter` (defined in the environment variables). Upon logging in, you'll arrive at the usual Jupyter notebook screen.

## Running the Tensorflow Example Notebooks

You can then create and execute your Jupyter notebooks like normal, for example, here is the [Tensorflow 2 Quickstart for Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) example from [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).

![tf 2.0 quickstart for beginners]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2021-03-07-TF_Docker/jupyter-beginner-notebook.png)

Additionally, you can see we already have tensorflow installed. As of 2021-04-09, the following dependencies are included in the `jupyter/tensorflow-notebook:latest` image:

```shell

**Note**, you can do this a few ways, but here are a couple of options: 
1. Create a terminal in the Jupyter server and execute `pip list`
2. From your command prompt, run `docker-compose run tf-jupyter pip list`

Additionally, since you mounted your notebook directory, all changes made within the container should presist to your local copies. However, warning, if you write to unmounted directories, your changes will disappear when you exit the container.

## Spinning Down Your Container

When you are done with your jupyter container, `ctrl+c` the terminal where you ran the `docker-compose up`, and you'll see the following prompt.

```shell
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping tf_tutorials_tf-jupyter_1 ... 
Killing tf_tutorials_tf-jupyter_1  ... done
```

To ensure the containers fully stop gracefully, execute:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Securing Environment Variables

Optionally, it is generally bad practice to define sensitive information such as passwords (i.e. `JUPYTER_TOKEN`) directly within your `docker-compose.yml`. Anyone who can see your file, then has access to your sensitive information. Instead, it is suggested you store this data in a `.env` file. For example, make a file called `.env` with the following line:

```shell
JUPYTER_TOKEN=jupyter
```

Make the following change to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
environment:
  - JUPYTER_TOKEN=${JUPYTER_TOKEN}
```

When you `docker-compose` `build` or `up`, the service will reference your `.env` file and look for the variable within the `${...}`. Therefore, you can store your sensitive data in a `.env` file and keep that protected.
